Here's a numerable, step-by-step development plan for the frontend part of the project, based on the provided architecture and best practices:

**Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure**

1. **Initialize the Project:**
    *   **Command:** `npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts` (or `yarn create vite frontend --template react-ts`)
    *   **Goal:** Set up the basic React project with TypeScript and Vite.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A functional React project skeleton in a `frontend` directory.

2. **Install Core Dependencies:**
    *   **Command:** `cd frontend && npm install react-router-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` (or `yarn add react-router-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`)
    *   **Goal:** Add routing, styling framework, and required PostCSS plugins.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Dependencies listed in `package.json`.

3. **Configure Tailwind CSS:**
    *   **Action:** Create `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files in the root of the `frontend` directory.
    *   **Content of `tailwind.config.js`:**
        ```javascript
        /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
        export default {
          content: [
            "./index.html",
            "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
          ],
          theme: {
            extend: {},
          },
          plugins: [],
        }
        ```
    *   **Content of `postcss.config.js`:**
        ```javascript
        import tailwindcss from 'tailwindcss';
        import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer';

        export default {
          plugins: [
            tailwindcss,
            autoprefixer,
          ],
        }
        ```
    *   **Action:** Add Tailwind directives to `src/index.css` (or create if it doesn't exist):
        ```css
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```
    *   **Goal:** Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Tailwind classes can be used in components.

4. **Organize Folder Structure:**
    *   **Action:** Create the following directories within the `src` folder: `components`, `context`, `services`, `pages`, `types`, `utils`.
    *   **Goal:** Establish the defined folder structure for separation of concerns.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Empty directories ready for component and logic implementation.

**Phase 2: Implementing Core Functionality**

5. **Define TypeScript Types:**
    *   **Action:** Create `src/types/form.ts` and define the necessary interfaces for form state, actions, and context. Based on the example, it would include `FormState`, `FormAction`, and `FormContextProps`.
    *   **Example `src/types/form.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        export interface FormState {
          formData: Record<string, any>;
          loading: boolean;
          error: string | null;
        }

        export type FormAction =
          | { type: "SET_FIELD"; payload: { field: string; value: any } }
          | { type: "SET_LOADING"; payload: boolean }
          | { type: "SET_ERROR"; payload: string | null }
          | { type: "SET_INITIAL_DATA"; payload: Record<string, any> };

        export interface FormContextProps {
          state: FormState;
          setField: (field: string, value: any) => void;
          submitForm: () => Promise<void>;
        }
        ```
    *   **Goal:** Implement strict typing for better code maintainability and fewer runtime errors.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Type definitions for form-related data and actions.

6. **Implement Context Provider:**
    *   **Action:** Create `src/context/FormProvider.tsx` and `src/context/useFormContext.ts`. Implement the `FormProvider` component using `useReducer` as shown in the example, including API interaction setup (even if the actual API calls are stubs for now).
    *   **Goal:** Set up global state management for the form.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A functional `FormProvider` that manages form state and provides `useFormContext` hook.

7. **Create API Service:**
    *   **Action:** Create `src/services/api.ts` to abstract API calls (can start with a basic fetch wrapper or a library like Axios later). Create `src/services/FormService.ts` with methods like `submit` and `fetchInitialData` (initially, these can return mock data or resolve immediately).
    *   **Goal:** Encapsulate API interaction logic.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Service classes ready to interact with the backend.

**Phase 3: Building UI Components and Pages**

8. **Create Reusable Input Component:**
    *   **Action:** Implement `src/components/form/Input.tsx` based on the provided example, including type definitions (`InputProps`).
    *   **Goal:** Build a reusable input component with labels, error handling, and helper text.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A functional `Input` component that can be used in forms.

9. **Create Main Form Component:**
    *   **Action:** Implement `src/components/form/Form.tsx`. This component will use the `useFormContext` hook to access and update form state and render the necessary `Input` components.
    *   **Goal:** Build the main form UI using the reusable input component and context.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A functional form component that displays input fields and handles user input.

10. **Create Pages:**
    *   **Action:** Implement `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` and `src/pages/ThankYouPage.tsx`. The `LandingPage` will integrate the `FormProvider` and `Form` component. The `ThankYouPage` will be a simple confirmation page.
    *   **Goal:** Create the application's routes and page structure.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Basic landing and thank-you pages.

11. **Set up Routing:**
    *   **Action:** Install `react-router-dom` (if not already done). Update `src/App.tsx` to configure routing using `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` components to navigate between `LandingPage` and `ThankYouPage`.
    *   **Goal:** Enable navigation between different parts of the application.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Navigable landing and thank-you pages.

**Phase 4: Enhancements and Refinements**

12. **Implement Form Validation:**
    *   **Action:** Integrate Yup or React Hook Form for robust client-side validation within the `Form` component and `FormProvider`. Update the `Input` component to display validation errors.
    *   **Goal:** Enhance form validation for better data integrity and user feedback.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Client-side form validation with error messages.

13. **Add Loading Indicators and Error Messages:**
    *   **Action:** Update the `Form` component to display a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) while the form is submitting. Display error messages from the context.
    *   **Goal:** Improve user experience during form submission.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Visual feedback for loading and error states.

14. **Ensure Mobile Responsiveness:**
    *   **Action:** Use Tailwind CSS responsive modifiers (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes. Test on various devices or use browser developer tools.
    *   **Goal:** Make the application accessible and usable on different devices.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A responsive layout that works well on mobile and desktop.

15. **Implement Session Storage (Optional Enhancement):**
    *   **Action:** Create a custom hook in `src/utils` or directly within the `FormProvider` to persist form data in session storage. Update the form state initialization to load data from session storage if available.
    *   **Goal:** Preserve user input in case of accidental page refresh or navigation.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Form data persists across sessions.

**Phase 5: Testing and Optimization**

16. **Implement Unit Tests (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   **Action:** Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest with React Testing Library) and write unit tests for components, context logic, and service classes.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the reliability and correctness of individual units of code.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Unit tests covering key functionalities.

17. **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Action:** Analyze component rendering performance. Use `React.memo` for optimizing presentational components. Consider lazy loading for less frequently used components or pages. Optimize image sizes if any.
    *   **Goal:** Improve the application's performance and responsiveness.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Optimized component rendering and faster load times.

**Phase 6: Final Touches and Deployment Preparation**

18. **SEO Optimization:**
    *   **Action:** Implement the SEO best practices outlined in the document, such as adding meta descriptions, title tags, semantic HTML, and alt text for images (if applicable).
    *   **Goal:** Improve the application's visibility to search engines.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** SEO-friendly frontend structure.

19. **Code Review and Cleanup:**
    *   **Action:** Review the codebase for consistency, readability, and adherence to best practices. Remove any unnecessary code or comments.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure high-quality and maintainable code.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Clean and well-structured codebase.

20. **Deployment Preparation:**
    *   **Action:** Configure build scripts for production deployment. Test the production build locally.
    *   **Goal:** Prepare the frontend for deployment.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A production-ready build of the frontend.

This step-by-step plan provides a structured approach to developing the frontend of the project, incorporating the defined architecture and best practices. Remember that this is a general guideline, and the specific implementation details might need adjustments based on the project's evolving requirements.
