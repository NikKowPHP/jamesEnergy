Here's a numerable, step-by-step development plan for the frontend part of the project, based on the provided architecture and best practices:


**Phase 3: Building UI Components and Pages**

8. **Create Reusable Input Component:**
    *   **Action:** Implement `src/components/form/Input.tsx` based on the provided example, including type definitions (`InputProps`).
    *   **Goal:** Build a reusable input component with labels, error handling, and helper text.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A functional `Input` component that can be used in forms.

9. **Create Main Form Component:**
    *   **Action:** Implement `src/components/form/Form.tsx`. This component will use the `useFormContext` hook to access and update form state and render the necessary `Input` components.
    *   **Goal:** Build the main form UI using the reusable input component and context.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A functional form component that displays input fields and handles user input.

10. **Create Pages:**
    *   **Action:** Implement `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` and `src/pages/ThankYouPage.tsx`. The `LandingPage` will integrate the `FormProvider` and `Form` component. The `ThankYouPage` will be a simple confirmation page.
    *   **Goal:** Create the application's routes and page structure.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Basic landing and thank-you pages.

11. **Set up Routing:**
    *   **Action:** Install `react-router-dom` (if not already done). Update `src/App.tsx` to configure routing using `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` components to navigate between `LandingPage` and `ThankYouPage`.
    *   **Goal:** Enable navigation between different parts of the application.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Navigable landing and thank-you pages.

**Phase 4: Enhancements and Refinements**

12. **Implement Form Validation:**
    *   **Action:** Integrate Yup or React Hook Form for robust client-side validation within the `Form` component and `FormProvider`. Update the `Input` component to display validation errors.
    *   **Goal:** Enhance form validation for better data integrity and user feedback.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Client-side form validation with error messages.

13. **Add Loading Indicators and Error Messages:**
    *   **Action:** Update the `Form` component to display a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) while the form is submitting. Display error messages from the context.
    *   **Goal:** Improve user experience during form submission.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Visual feedback for loading and error states.

14. **Ensure Mobile Responsiveness:**
    *   **Action:** Use Tailwind CSS responsive modifiers (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes. Test on various devices or use browser developer tools.
    *   **Goal:** Make the application accessible and usable on different devices.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A responsive layout that works well on mobile and desktop.

15. **Implement Session Storage (Optional Enhancement):**
    *   **Action:** Create a custom hook in `src/utils` or directly within the `FormProvider` to persist form data in session storage. Update the form state initialization to load data from session storage if available.
    *   **Goal:** Preserve user input in case of accidental page refresh or navigation.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Form data persists across sessions.

**Phase 5: Testing and Optimization**

16. **Implement Unit Tests (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   **Action:** Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest with React Testing Library) and write unit tests for components, context logic, and service classes.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the reliability and correctness of individual units of code.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Unit tests covering key functionalities.

17. **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Action:** Analyze component rendering performance. Use `React.memo` for optimizing presentational components. Consider lazy loading for less frequently used components or pages. Optimize image sizes if any.
    *   **Goal:** Improve the application's performance and responsiveness.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Optimized component rendering and faster load times.

**Phase 6: Final Touches and Deployment Preparation**

18. **SEO Optimization:**
    *   **Action:** Implement the SEO best practices outlined in the document, such as adding meta descriptions, title tags, semantic HTML, and alt text for images (if applicable).
    *   **Goal:** Improve the application's visibility to search engines.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** SEO-friendly frontend structure.

19. **Code Review and Cleanup:**
    *   **Action:** Review the codebase for consistency, readability, and adherence to best practices. Remove any unnecessary code or comments.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure high-quality and maintainable code.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Clean and well-structured codebase.

20. **Deployment Preparation:**
    *   **Action:** Configure build scripts for production deployment. Test the production build locally.
    *   **Goal:** Prepare the frontend for deployment.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A production-ready build of the frontend.

This step-by-step plan provides a structured approach to developing the frontend of the project, incorporating the defined architecture and best practices. Remember that this is a general guideline, and the specific implementation details might need adjustments based on the project's evolving requirements.
